# HelHist Article

Generates custom aliases for articles based on the values in taxonomy fields
  - field_phenomena
  - field_neighbourhoods
  - field_turning_points.
An article can be linked to multiple terms/taxonomies but one will act as
the primary and be used to generate node alias (and breadcrumb path).
